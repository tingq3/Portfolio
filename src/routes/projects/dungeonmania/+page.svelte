  <p>Dungeon Mania is a project I created in <a href=https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2021/COMP2511 target="_blank">
    UNSW Comp2511 Course</a>, It is a complex dungeon crawler game which I completed as the leader of a small team of students. The gameâ€™s rules were designed to challenge our design skills, with extremely complex requirements for player and enemy movement.</p>

  <p> 
    In order to implement this project, we made heavy use of design patterns and the object-oriented paradigm to encapsulate complex behaviours in simple interfaces.
  </p>

  <p>
    As this project was a university project, the source code is not public. However, I am able to grant access to potential employers on request.
