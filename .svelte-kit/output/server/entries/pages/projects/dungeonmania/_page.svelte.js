The gameâ€™s rules were designed to challenge our design skills, with extremely complex requirements for player and enemy movement.</p> <p>In order to implement this project, we made heavy use of design patterns and the object-oriented paradigm to encapsulate complex behaviours in simple interfaces.</p> <p>As this project was a university project, the source code is not public. However, I am able to grant access to potential employers on request.</p> <!--[-->`;
